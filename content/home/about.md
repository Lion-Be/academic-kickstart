# Biography

Lion Behrens is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim and a research associate at the [Collaborative Research Center 884](http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de) on the Political Economy of Reforms. 

His methodological research centers around Bayesian statistics and how it can improve researchers' substantial inferences from data. Extending the framework of meta-analytic approaches, he currently implements a method that allows for synthesizing evidence when stemming from heterogeneous statistical models as commonly applied in the social and political sciences. In his substantive work, he applies quantitative methods to the study of political behavior. His first publication focuses on young party members and their different incentives for partisan engagement over three latent categories.
