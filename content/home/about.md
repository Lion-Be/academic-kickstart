# Biography
Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim and a research associate at the [Collaborative Research Center 884](http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de) on the Political Economy of Reforms. In my substantive work, I apply quantitative methods to the study of electoral fraud and legislative behavior. Methodologically, I am interested in Monte Carlo simulations and the merit that Bayesian inference provides for the social sciences. My first publication (*Research & Politics*) focuses on young party members and their different incentives for partisan engagement over three latent categories.
