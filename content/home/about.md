# Biography

Lion Behrens is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim and a research associate at the [Collaborative Research Center 884](http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de) on the Political Economy of Reforms. His methodological research centers around Bayesian statistics and how it can improve substantial inferences. Currently, he implements a method that allows research to synthesize evidence even if stemming from such heterogeneous statistical models as often seen in Political Science. In his substantive work, he applies quantitative methods to the study of political behavior. His first publication focuses on young party members and their different incentives for partisan engagement over three latent categories.
